But it's this small town pride that you can feel in the people and places of Athens GA<strong>.</strong></div><a href="/tour-the-shop" class="get_started back w-button">TAKE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;&nbsp;TOUR</a><a href="/meet-shopcat" class="get_started back w-button">MEET&nbsp;SHOPCAT</a><div class="div-block-4"><p class="body_text">Our swagger is born out of the rock shows and college football tailgates we all attend, as well as the late night dance parties and magical summer nights spent night swimming. In Athens, the excitement, energy and creativity of youth can last a lifetime and it informs everything we do and who we are. This same energy is what runs vibrantly through Satisfactory. Like many businesses, we started small. It's in a kitchen and living room of a house on the corner of Prince and Oglethorpe avenue that our owner began to decipher the mysteries and beauty of screen printing. Designing and hand printing artwork for his roommates' bands when they regularly piled into vans to perform for audiences outside the safe confines of our local music scene.</p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5cdda85fdd56267f267e339e/5cf67cad7a1e2cda49348071_shopcatcameo.png" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/5cdda85fdd56267f267e339e/5cf67cad7a1e2cda49348071_shopcatcameo-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/5cdda85fdd56267f267e339e/5cf67cad7a1e2cda49348071_shopcatcameo.png 582w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 218.390625px, 282px" alt="" class="image-6"/></div><p class="body_text full">Ever since these formative years, we have been personally vested in the success of our clients by making them look good and meeting their needs all along the way. As many clients grew we grew with them, moving beyond what can be produced manually and increasing our capacity to meet growing demand. That ATH pride is pervasive throughout our staff and even our shop cat. With a crew that has expanded into a tight knit group of creative and like minded individuals, we are able to increase output and maintain our high standards while making sure to meet deadlines. As we've added the capability of automated printing presses, we have not wavered from our dedication to great design, top quality service and a commitment to produce beautiful results. Today, we still operate manual screen printing presses along with larger automated machines. For each client, we make sure we use the right tool for the job at hand. We'll still handle the smaller 24 piece orders for your new band, but we can also effortlessly produce the 5000+ piece order for your multi-state corporation and distribute individualized quantities across the nation...all with that small town ATH swagger.</p></div><a href="/quote-request" class="get_started w-button">READY&nbsp;TO&nbsp;GET&nbsp;STARTED?</a></div>
